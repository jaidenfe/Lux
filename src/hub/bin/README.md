Installation of Hub Software onto Raspberry Pi:

	There are two ways to set up the Lux Hub on a Raspberry Pi. Both
	methods require the Raspberry Pi to have access to the internet.
	The first way is to clone the Lux repository from GitHub and
	follow the directions below:

		- First cd into the 'Lux/src/hub/bin/' directory
		- Then run the 'hub_setup' script by typing './hub_setup'
		- Note: you may have to run this script as root ('sudo ./hub_setup')

	The other way to set up the Lux Hub on a Raspberry Pi is to download
	the hub_setup script and run it from anywhere on the system.
		- Change into the directory containing the hub_setup script
		- Run the Script by typing './hub_setup'
		- Note: You may need to run the script as root ('sudo ./hub_setup')
