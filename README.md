# Lux

This project aims to create a low cost home automation illumination device that will turn any lamp or light source into a smart light source. Instead of replacing the light blub or wall socket, we aim to replace the light socket itself, allowing the user to conintue using the light blubs they already have for their homes. 

<h3>Compiling</h3>

The project is currently compiled by running the makefile in the tests/server folder.

make server_test

<h3>Execution</h3>

*plug the Lux device into a light bulb socket and plug a light bulb into the female socket

*start the Lux device and connect to the ESP_XXXX website via localhost:8080

*provide the website with the IP address of your WiFi network

*start/connect a controller device (PC/Phone) to your WiFi

*compile and run the server_test.exe in the tests/server folder as instructed above

*push the RED button on the Lux device

*connect to the website at localhost:5000
